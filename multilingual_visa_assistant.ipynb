    "In this project, we’re building a Multilingual Travel Visa Assistant that can answer visa-related questions for countries like Canada, the US, or the UK using real-time data scraped from official government websites. The assistant supports multiple languages — users can ask their questions in their native language, and receive responses in the same language. We’ll combine a custom web scraper, a vector search engine, a translation layer, and a language model to build an interactive Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system.\n",

    "For this project, we'll set up a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using webpages from official government sites that provide visitor visa information. The scraped visa content from these trusted sources will form the knowledge base. This content will be indexed using vector embeddings and retrieved dynamically to give relevant context to an LLM (GPT-4), which will then answer user questions accurately and conversationally."

      "Answer translated back to fr: Les citoyens canadiens ne nécessitent généralement pas de visas pour entrer aux États-Unis à des fins de visite, de tourisme et de voyage dans les affaires temporaires. Cependant, ils ont besoin de visas non immigrants à des fins spécifiques telles que d'agir en tant que responsables du gouvernement étranger, des fonctionnaires et des employés d'organisations internationales, des responsables de l'OTAN, des représentants et des employés, des commerçants de traités, des investisseurs traités, ou s'ils sont le conjoint ou l'enfant d'un traité australien qui venait uniquement aux États-Unis pour se produire. De plus, les citoyens canadiens qui sont inadmissibles aux États-Unis en vertu de la loi sur l'immigration des États-Unis ou qui ont précédemment violé les termes de leur statut d'immigration aux États-Unis, doivent demander un visa.\n"

      "Answer in English: If you're planning to travel to the UK for educational purposes, you can do so as a Standard Visitor. You are allowed to study courses up to 6 months. If you're planning to study or research certain subjects at postgraduate level or above, you may need to get an Academic Technology Approval Scheme (ATAS) certificate before you start your course or research. Please note that the accredited UK institution cannot be an academy or state-funded school.\n",
